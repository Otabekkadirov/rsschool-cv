### CODING EXAMPLE

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009/javascript>

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list `a`, which are present in list `b` keeping their order.

> `arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]`

If a value is present in `b`, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

> `arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]`

**My solution:**

```
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  b.forEach((el) => {
    let currentIndex = a.indexOf(el);
    while(currentIndex !== -1) {
      a.splice(currentIndex, 1);
      currentIndex = a.indexOf(el);
    }
  })
  return a;
}
```
